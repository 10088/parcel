      Yes, this is Parcel as a (nearly) self-hosting bundler (self-

      The Parcel portion of this page, including all compilers, is a 2.2MB

      Known issues:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Minifying CSS doesn't work (runtime <code>require</code> calls by
          cssnano, even for the config to disable the corresponding plugin...)
        </li>
        <li>
          Node builtin modules can't be polyfilled for the browser (looks up the
          bundler, caused by Parcel's <code>require.resolve</code> handling)
        </li>
        <li>
          Babel would need to <code>require</code> plugins at runtime (at least
          without workarounds)
        </li>
        <li>
